Jakarta EE Servers and Containers
---------------------------------

A Jakarta EE server is a server application that implements the Jakarta EE
platform APIs and provides standard Jakarta EE services. Jakarta EE servers
are sometimes called application servers, because they allow you to
serve application data to clients, much as web servers serve web pages
to web browsers.

Jakarta EE servers host several application component types that correspond
to the tiers in a multitiered application. The Jakarta EE server provides
services to these components in the form of a container.

Jakarta EE containers are the interface between the component and the
lower-level functionality provided by the platform to support that
component. The functionality of the container is defined by the platform
and is different for each component type. Nonetheless, the server allows
the different component types to work together to provide functionality
in an enterprise application.

The Web Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web container is the interface between web components and the web
server. A web component can be a servlet or a Jakarta Faces Facelets
page. The container manages the component's life cycle, dispatches
requests to application components, and provides interfaces to context
data, such as information about the current request.

The Jakarta Enterprise Beans Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Jakarta Enterprise Beans container is the interface between enterprise beans, which
provide the business logic in a Jakarta EE application, and the Jakarta EE
server. The Jakarta Enterprise Beans container runs on the Jakarta EE server and manages the
execution of an application's enterprise beans.

The Application Client Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application client container is the interface between Jakarta EE
application clients (special Java SE applications that use Jakarta EE
server components) and the Jakarta EE server. The application client
container runs on the client machine and is the gateway between the
client application and the Jakarta EE server components that the client
uses.
