Modifying the Jakarta Enterprise Bean
------------------------------------

`DukesBirthdayBean` is a _stateless session bean_. Stateless session beans
are Jakarta Enterprise Beans that do not maintain a conversational state with a
client. With stateless session beans, the client makes isolated requests
that do not depend on any previous state or requests. If an application
requires conversational state, use _stateful session beans_.

`DukesBirthdayBean` is a local enterprise bean that uses a no-interface
view:

* A _local enterprise bean_ is visible only within the application in
which it is deployed.
* Enterprise beans with a _no-interface_ view do not need a separate
business interface that the enterprise bean class implements. The
enterprise bean class is the only coding artifact needed to create a
local, no-interface enterprise bean.

`DukesBirthdayBean` will be packaged within the same WAR file as the
Facelets web front end.

Implement a Business Method to DukesBirthdayBean that Gets the Average Age Difference of firstcup-war Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add code to a business method to the `DukesBirthdayBean` session bean to
call the `findAverageAgeDifferenceOfAllFirstcupUsers` named query in
`FirstcupUser` that returns the average age difference of all users.

1.  Expand the *Source Packages* node, expand the `firstcup.ejb` node,
then double-click the `DukesBirthdayBean.java` file to open it in the
editor window.
2.  Find the business method called `getAverageAgeDifference` and add
the following code in bold by copying and pasting:
+
[source,oac_no_warn,subs=+quotes]
----
    public Double getAverageAgeDifference() {
        *Double avgAgeDiff = (Double)
            em.createNamedQuery("findAverageAgeDifferenceOfAllFirstcupUsers")
                                .getSingleResult();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Average age difference is: {0}",  avgAgeDiff);
        return avgAgeDiff;*
    }
----
+
The named query in `FirstcupUser` is called by using the `createNamedQuery` method
in `EntityManager`. Because this query returns
a single number, the `getSingleResult` method is called on the returned
`Query` object. The query returns a `Double`.
3.  Right-click in the editor window and select *Format*.

[[GKGOT]][[implement-a-business-method-for-calculating-the-age-difference-between-duke-and-the-user]]

Implement a Business Method for Calculating the Age Difference Between Duke and the User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add code to a business method that calculates the difference in age in
years between Duke and the user and creates a new `FirstcupUser` entity.

1.  Find the `getAgeDifference` business method and add the following
code in bold:
+
[source,oac_no_warn,subs=+quotes]
----
    public int getAgeDifference(Date date) {
        *int ageDifference;

        Calendar theirBirthday = new GregorianCalendar();
        Calendar dukesBirthday = new GregorianCalendar(1995, Calendar.MAY, 23);

        // Set the Calendar object to the passed-in Date
        theirBirthday.setTime(date);

        // Subtract the user's age from Duke's age
        ageDifference = dukesBirthday.get(Calendar.YEAR)
                - theirBirthday.get(Calendar.YEAR);
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Raw ageDifference is: {0}",  ageDifference);
        // Check to see if Duke's birthday occurs before the user's. If so,
        // subtract one from the age difference
        if (dukesBirthday.before(theirBirthday) && (ageDifference> 0)) {
            ageDifference--;
        }

        // Create and store the user's birthday in the database
        FirstcupUser user = new FirstcupUser(date, ageDifference);
        em.persist(user);

        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Final ageDifference is: {0}",  ageDifference);

        return ageDifference;*
    }
----
+
This method creates the `Calendar` objects used to calculate the
difference in age between the user and Duke and performs the actual
calculation of the difference in age.
+
Similar to the `DukesAgeResource.getText` code, `getAgeDifference`
subtracts Duke's birthday year from the user's birthday year to get a
raw age difference. If Duke's birthday falls before the user's, and the
raw difference is more than 0, it subtracts one year from the age
difference.
+
A new `FirstcupUser` entity is created with the user's birthday and age
difference, then stored in Derby by calling the `persist` method
in `EntityManager`.
+
The final age difference is returned as an `int`.
